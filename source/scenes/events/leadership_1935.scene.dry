=  Labour Party Leadership Election

It is now time for the party's representation in the House of Commons to elect a new party leader after the general election. Since Lansbury stood down as leader, Clement Attlee has served in the position. As this has been on an interim basis, it means he will very likely face a challenger. [? if lab_c > old_lab_c: This is especially true after the Party increased its representation in the House of Commons. ?]

- @leadership_algorithm: Who are the candidates?

@1935_candidates
go-to: candidate_menu

Clement Attlee, the current leader, is running.

[? if morrison_runs: Herbert Morrison is running. He has just won back his seat at the last general election. ?]

[? if greenwood_runs: Arthur Greenwood is running. ?]

@candidate_menu

- @attlee_wins: Clement Attlee has a majority!
- @morrison_wins: Herbert Morrison has a majority!
- @greenwood_wins: Arthur Greenwood has a majority!
- @another_round: There will need to be another round of voting. 

@attlee_wins
choose-if: attlee_percentage > 0.5
on-arrival: pragmatist_strength += 5;
go-to: first_round_results if lab_round = 1; second_round_results

Clement Attlee, the current leader, has won the leadership election! Ideologically, Attlee is pragmatic, with a past history of more radical socialism. This does not change things dramatically, though Attlee is yet to prove himself.

@morrison_wins
view-if: morrison_runs
choose-if: morrison_percentage > 0.5
on-arrival: labour_leader = "Morrison"; working_lab += 1.1; working_con -= 1.1; middle_lab += 0.9; reformist_strength += 10; reformist_dissent -= 5; pragmatist_strength += 5;
go-to: first_round_results if lab_round = 1; second_round_results

Herbert Morrison has won the leadership election! Ideologically, Morrison is a reformist, though more pragmatist-aligned, and will help increase the party's electorate through his command of electioneering.

@greenwood_wins
view-if: greenwood_runs
choose-if: greenwood_percentage > 0.5
on-arrival: labour_leader = "Morrison"; working_lab += 0.6; working_con -= 0.3; working_ind_lab -= 0.1; working_communist -= 0.1; working_other -= 0.1; labour_strength += 10; labour_dissent -= 10;
go-to: first_round_results if lab_round = 1; second_round_results

Arthur Greenwood has won the leadership election! Ideologically, Greenwood is very closely tied to the trade unions and can help unite them towards us, decreasing the pull of dissident working-class parties. This is sure to help us.

@another_round
view-if: lab_round = 1
choose-if: attlee_percentage < 0.5 and morrison_percentage < 0.5 and greenwood_percentage < 0.5
